            Steps to find the multiples:
                    1- Create a list variable to store the multiples, 
                    a choice made given the variable nature of the list size, 
                    since the number of multiples depends directly on the value of the length variable.

                    2- Make a loop where from 1 to length:
                        a) Calculate the multiple of length by number.
                        b) Include this value in the list.
                    3- Convert the list to an array, since this is the function's return format.
                    4- Return the array in the function's return.
